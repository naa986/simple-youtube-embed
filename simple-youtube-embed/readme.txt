= Simple YouTube Embed Usage =

Create a new post/page and enter your YouTube video URL to embed it. Make sure the URL is on its own line and not hyperlinked (clickable when viewing the post). In order to avoid formatting errors, It's better to place the URL into the content area in text mode. For example:

`http&#58;//www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpg9yizPP_g`

**Related YouTube Videos**

In order to disable related videos from showing you can add "rel=0" to your YouTube URL.

`http&#58;//www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpg9yizPP_g&rel=0`

**YouTube Video Controls**

If you do not want to show player controls you can add "controls=0" to your YouTube URL.

`http&#58;//www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpg9yizPP_g&controls=0`

**YouTube Video Info**

If you do not want to show information like the video title and uploader you can add "showinfo=0" to your YouTube URL.

`http&#58;//www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpg9yizPP_g&showinfo=0`

**YouTube Video Fullscreen**

If you do not want to allow fullscreen option in the player you can add "fs=0" to your YouTube URL.

`http&#58;//www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpg9yizPP_g&fs=0`
