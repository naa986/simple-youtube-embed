Embed YouTube videos in WordPress with lazy loading beautifully. Embed YouTube video with a URL or shortcode and customize the player using this YouTube embed plugin.

== Description ==

[Simple YouTube Embed](https://noorsplugin.com/simple-youtube-embed-plugin/) plugin is the easiest way to embed YouTube videos in WordPress with native lazy loading support. This plugin extends the default YouTube embed with advanced player parameters.

Simple YouTube Embed allows you to lazy load your videos by using the native lazy loading mechanism supported in your browser (The same mechanism that WordPress uses to lazy load images). 

Unlike other YouTube plugins, It doesn't replace your on-page video embed code with JavaScript/HTML code. Loading a video with JavaScript doesn't provide any video SEO benefit as a search engine crawler will only see some code instead of the actual video object. 

Simple YouTube Embed is easy to use because there is no setting to configure. It uses the oEmbed API so your videos will be responsive and provide all the benefits that core WordPress YouTube embed has to offer. YouTube videos on your website will continue to work even if you choose to deactivate the plugin.
